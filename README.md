Image segmentation based on convolutional neural networks is proving to be a powerful and efficient solution for medical applications. However, the lack of annotated data, presence of artifacts and variability in appearance can still result in inconsistencies during the inference. We choose to take advantage of the invariant nature of anatomical structures, by enforcing a semantic constraint to improve the robustness of the segmentation. The proposed solution is applied on a brain structures segmentation task, where the output of the network is constrained to satisfy a known adjacency graph of the brain regions. This criteria is introduced during the training through an original penalization loss named NonAdjLoss. With the help of a new metric, we show that the proposed approach significantly reduces abnormalities produced during the segmentation. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework can be used in a semi-supervised way, opening a path to better generalization to unseen data.

# NonAdjacencyLoss
The code will be released soon, stay up to date by adding a star !
The NonAdjacency loss can be applied to any pre-trained models, you will first need to extract the adjacency prior from an annotated training set and finally re-train your model to enforce the constraint on the model's output. You can also apply it on new images without ground truth !
